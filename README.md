Debian Based Distro for people like me

This is just a normal Debian distro with many tweaks inspired by many other setups, amongst others:

* [Raspbian/Spindle](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/spindle)
* Multistrap
* Preseeding
* [Vmdebootstrap](http://git.liw.fi/cgi-bin/cgit/cgit.cgi/vmdebootstrap/tree/README) 
* [Emdebian](http://www.emdebian.org) RIP

My ultimate goal is to have a full busybox based root filesystem but with Debian this is impossible currently. My second goal is to have a Debian based rootfs mimicking Raspbian as close as possible.
